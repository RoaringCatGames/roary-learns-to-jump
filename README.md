# Roary Learns to Jump

This is a from scratch Unity project that we will be using to teach ourselves the platform. As we need to learn how to do something we'll add a Scene or feature to this game to learn how it can be done the Unity way.

As of the initial commit, it just has a background image, a player that can jump and move on a single platform. There is a light. That's all.
